we’re going to build a super cool Python project called GIRI – Your Personal Voice Assistant.

It can:

✅ Listen to your voice
✅ Understand what you said
✅ Open Chrome or VS Code
✅ Play songs on YouTube
✅ Tell jokes
✅ Give you the current time
✅ Tell who someone is using Wikipedia
✅ And most importantly… it talks about you!

Sounds cool? Let’s get started
